<h1>Celia Ford</h1>
    
<p>I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, currently deep in the weeds studying how our brains represent <i>context</i>:</p>
<p>Given the state of the world around us, how should we behave? And how should we adapt if the rules of our world change?</p>
    
<p>I'm here in the J-School because I'm interested in exploring a life in science journalism and/or public radio after graduation. Basically, I want whatever <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/people/latif-nasser">Latif Nasser</a> is having.</p>
  
<p>I spend the rest of my time pole dancing, playing bass guitar, and cuddling my very needy cat daughter, Charlotte.</p>
